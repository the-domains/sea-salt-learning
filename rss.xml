            <description><![CDATA[<p>We have to disrupt the status quo if we wish to effect change: disruption that can either be generated internally, or imposed from outside. When we consider how to move an organisation from ‘Resistant‘, where it denies and starves change conversations, to ‘Constrained‘, where it is building the foundations for change and trying to overcome inertia, we need to find or experience that disturbance too, but under the constraints of a Resistant organisation, it’s hard to discover or create the space to have these conversations. By it’s nature, the Resistant organisation resists change… it self perpetuates its stagnation.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>An organisation restricted by technology may display certain key behaviours. It may exert control, over what systems are used and, crucially, which systems can’t be used. It will fail to provide space for experimentation and will display a marked resistance to even having the conversation (deploying Starvation and Denial antibodies). An organisation restricted by technology will use the argument that it has to control you to be safe, to remain compliant, to reduce risk, to control cost, to ensure consistency, to drive certain behaviours, to achieve global uniformity, to give you what’s best for you, to be effective. And all these things may be true.  But.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Emergent Ritual</h1><p>The meaning of things can fall into history, even when the artefact itself persists. Like why we shake hands. Or give three kisses on the cheek. Or bow. Rituals, embedded in our culture, but not in any sense natural behaviours. They are invented, created, adopted and persist, even when the original logic and thinking of...</p><img src="https://julianstodd.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image7.png?w=640&h=480"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Change Curve: Grounding your Authenticity</h1><p>The Change model i've been exploring over the past few months outlines three manifestations of change within an organisation: they can be 'Resistant' to it, 'Constrained' by it, or become 'Dynamic'. To start the journey to Dynamic, we start by segmenting the resistance: breaking it down into manageable chunks, working on each one and laying...</p><img src="https://julianstodd.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/image22.jpg?w=640&h=480"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Change Curve: Overcoming Stasis</h1><p>I'm elaborating aspects of the Change Curve framework, a piece of work i'm developing to help organisations move from 'Resistant' to change to 'Dynamic'.
