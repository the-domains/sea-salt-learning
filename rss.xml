            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Change Curve: Resistant Behaviours</h1><p>I've been exploring the 16 Resistors of change in more details as we look at how to segment and overcome the inertia. Today i'm looking at four aspects of resistance that sit under the heading of 'Behaviour'. These are 'habit', habitual responses triggered by familiar situations, 'elasticity', which is about understanding where the flex is...</p><img src="https://julianstodd.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_5774.jpg?w=640&h=480"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Change: To Own Or To Allocate?</h1><p>Just #WorkingOutLoud today as i start on the second part of the model that will take us from Resistant to change to simply Constrained. Over the last few days i've explored how we can segment resistance into 16 different areas, and the ways we can tackle each one.</p><img src="https://julianstodd.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/image10.png?w=640&h=480"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An introduction to Scaffolded Social Learning</h1><p>I'm sharing this: it's a short 'Introduction to Social Learning', intended as a foundation for people new to the subject. It's a first iteration: see what you think and let me know if you have ideas! What is Social Learning? Formal learning is what we do in classrooms, in eLearning modules, in workbooks.</p><img src="https://julianstodd.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_5793.jpg?w=640&h=480"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Future of Learning? It's Here.</h1><p>I've spent the last couple of days sharing stories and talking to some great people: curious, intrigued, speculating, experimenting and learning. Pondering how to take their organisations forward, how to adapt them, change them, to make them fit for the Social Age. Much of the conversation has been about what learning should look like in...</p><img src="https://julianstodd.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/image12.jpg?w=640&h=480"></article>]]></description>
