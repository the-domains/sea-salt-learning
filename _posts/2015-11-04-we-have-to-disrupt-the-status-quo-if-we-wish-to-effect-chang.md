We have to disrupt the status quo if we wish to effect change: disruption that can either be generated internally, or imposed from outside. When we consider how to move an organisation from 'Resistant', where it denies and starves change conversations, to 'Constrained', where it is building the foundations for change and trying to overcome inertia, we need to find or experience that disturbance too, but under the constraints of a Resistant organisation, it's hard to discover or create the space to have these conversations. By it's nature, the Resistant organisation resists change... it self perpetuates its stagnation.
