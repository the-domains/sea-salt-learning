An organisation restricted by technology may display certain key behaviours. It may exert control, over what systems are used and, crucially, which systems can't be used. It will fail to provide space for experimentation and will display a marked resistance to even having the conversation (deploying Starvation and Denial antibodies). An organisation restricted by technology will use the argument that it has to control you to be safe, to remain compliant, to reduce risk, to control cost, to ensure consistency, to drive certain behaviours, to achieve global uniformity, to give you what's best for you, to be effective. And all these things may be true. But.
